           <b>DigiPAKISTAN</b> a Skills Development Initiative is highly appreciated and appeared as a ray of hope for the youth who are job searcher today. <b>DigiPAKISTAN</b> will transform the youth from job taker to job creator which is a wonderful program. Youth must step in the IT field and excel as it has emerged as the biggest business after Covid-19.

            <p className='text-sm text-justify md:text-xl mt-2'>
            On the platform of <b>Pakistan Engineering Council</b>, I make a call to all engineers to ensure their attachment with <b>DigiPAKISTAN</b> and start developing your skills in the IT programs offered by this initiative. You can earn more than <b>$50</b> a day using freelancing websites and working from home. There is an acute shortage of jobs at present and no need to pursue them, you are engineers <b>MASHAALLAH</b>   and can easily acquire IT expertise which will also become part of your personality. These IT skills will support you in whatever field you are, no field will succeed without IT, may is be Electro medical, may it be mining, may it be mechanical, may it be electrical or may it be chemical, so move forward with IT.
